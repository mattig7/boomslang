How to Install Boomslang

Currently the only way to install Boomslang is to download the code from Github at https://github.com/driscollis/boomslang

You will need the following installed:

 - Python 3.5+
 - wxPython 4+
 - lxml 3.8+

The easiest way to conduct the installation of packages (assuming python is installed correctly) is to navigate to the installed boomslang folder and use the command:
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

A virtual environment is recommended. Create one with the command:
python -m venv env
Then activate the virtual environment with the (linux) command:
source env/Scripts/activate


Assuming all of the above is installed, then all you need to do is run main.py.
